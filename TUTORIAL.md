# Tutorial how to use Discord.JS-Leveling-Bot

# Installing

## Installing Node.JS
Before running everything, you must have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed, or click [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to install.

## Installing Python
In order to install [better-sqlite3](https://github.com/JoshuaWise/better-sqlite3) you must have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed in order to work.

## Installing DB Browser (optional)
If you wish to see what is inside the database file, you can use [DB Browser](https://sqlitebrowser.org/) this also can be use if you are debugging or monitoring user XP/Levels.

## Installing Packages
After installing [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), you need to install all of the packages listed in `package.json` file. On Console/Terminal, run `npm install` command to install all of uninstalled packages. Wait for it to finish and you good to go!

## File Setup
After installing packages, now you can copy your Discord Bot Token in `config.json.example` file, and rename `config.json.example` to `config.json`, fill your Discord Bot Token, your User ID and Prefix. After that, you can choose which Rank Card you wish to use for Your Discord Bot:

> Canvacord

> Canvas

**YOU CAN ONLY CHOOSE ONE OF THE FILE!!!**
Remove .canvacord or .canvas if you want to choose which card you think better.

All of that done, we can now make the Bot online.


# Running the Bot

## Getting the Bot online for the First Time
On your Console/Terminal, run `node index.js` or `node .` to run the bot! But you can't make it online forever unless you leave your PC/Code Editor/Console online for 24/7. You can host your Bot with Virtual Server/VPS/Discord Bot Hosting Services, here are some recommendation;


# Hosting Services

REMINDER: ALL OF THIS MIGHT BE OUTDATED AND IM TOO LAZY TO UPDATE IT LOL :P

## Something.Host
I've been using [Something.Host](https://something.host/en/) for 8 months, and it's great. Easy to use, and extremely cheap, with the lowest price at 1.49 â‚¬ / month!

## DanBot Hosting
If you don't have money to host, well [DanBot Hosting](discord.gg/dbh) is for you! It's easy to use, but every free stuff comes with risks. Well DanBot Hosting is pretty slow and server always goes offline randomly, but it's a great start.

## Which Hosting Services you shouldn't use.
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) is honestly not good for hosting your bot, your bot will run slow or having lag issues, You will not be able to write data in your Database with Heroku.
- You are also not supposed to use repl.it. I believe that repl.it does not support better-sqlite3.


# Closing
